# What is AMQP?
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open standard protocol for message-oriented middleware. It enables applications to send and receive messages asynchronously and reliably across different platforms and technologies.
Key features of AMQP:

* Message-oriented: Focuses on the delivery of discrete messages
* Queuing: Stores messages until the receiving application can process them
* Routing: Supports various message routing patterns (point-to-point, publish-subscribe)
* Reliability: Guarantees message delivery with features like acknowledgments and transactions
* Security: Provides authentication and encryption mechanisms
* Platform-independence: Allows communication between applications written in different languages

AMQP is commonly implemented by message brokers like RabbitMQ, Apache ActiveMQ, and Azure Service Bus.
# What does "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672" mean?
Breaking down this connection string:

* amqp:// - The protocol identifier
* First "guest" - Username for authentication to the message broker
* Second "guest" - Password for authentication to the message broker
* localhost - The hostname where the message broker is running (your local machine)
*  5672 - The default port number for AMQP connections

This connection string tells the application to connect to a RabbitMQ server running on your local machine at port 5672, using "guest" as both the username and password for authentication.
